Repo currently contains utils for data manipulation in order to make trainable sets for Convolutional Neural Networks (likely YOLO and similar).

First commit, bad and ugly, no good. 

Scripts with fixed paths, no arguments, everything is at the stage where it sometimes works on one machine.

Read the code before running anything and then refrain from running it.

Dependencies so far are:
PIL
json
PASCAL VOC Writer (https://github.com/AndrewCarterUK/pascal-voc-writer/blob/master/README.rst#pascal-voc-writer)
